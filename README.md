**Planning**
  The history behind the idea:
    The project brief invites us to create something that we enjoy personally, so I tried to pull from personal stories for inspiration. As a kid, I often witnessed my mother holding tarot reading sessions for friends and family members. I was never a believer, but for a lot of relatives the mysticism behind Tarot was a kind of connection to a part of the family history that they'd lost touch with - my grandfather was from a large gypsy family, but my grandmother was not, so after they both died their children were not accepted by the rest of the family, which led to my mother and her siblings feeling like a portion of their ethnical heritage was lost. What little they did learn about their father's heritage was shrouded in mystery and magic.
    
  The feature:
    I've decided to create a simple Tarot deck. Users will be invited to draw a card for their reading, but before they do they will see 8 cards facing down on the screen. I'm hoping to replicate the experience of a real reading as much as possible, so when the user is ready to draw, the cards will actually shuffle, before one is picked - meaning that each of the down-facing cards will be assigned a randomised tarot value before the user actually picks which one to reveal.
    
When receiving a tarot reading, you must set the intention for the session by asking what you hope the cards will reveal to you. To simulate this, I will add a dropdown menu that allows users to select a topic. In this case, the three most common general choices will be available: love, money & health.
